# Scanner
To explain how the get_next_token() function works, it reads the next token by the help of [buffer_reader.py](https://github.com/ArshiAAkhavan/C-minus-compiler/blob/master/scanner/buffer_reader.py); buffer_reader inputs a file and returns its characters one by one. The line number of the input file is also tracked ,for reporting errors and tokens, by counting the number of "\n"'s in the file.
This scanner recognizes tokens by a structure defined in [lang.py](https://github.com/ArshiAAkhavan/C-minus-compiler/blob/master/scanner/lang.py). Basically, this structure is a dfa in code; each state is either a middle or final state and has some edges which if the current character is in (include function) or is not in (exclude function) the state is changed to the next defined state. Each state also takes a function as input; if the state is a final state upon entering the state the function is called and if it's a normal state, if the current character can not move to another state by the edges the function is triggered. In this project the functions in [actions.py](https://github.com/ArshiAAkhavan/C-minus-compiler/blob/master/scanner/actions.py) are used as input functions; these functions either recognize a token in final state cases or generate an error. In the case of final state, the node can push back the last character if needed.
The dfa for this compiler is defined in multiple functions in [default_scanner.py](https://github.com/ArshiAAkhavan/C-minus-compiler/blob/master/scanner/default_scanner.py), by passing them the start node of dfa they all become a connected dfa that recognizes the tokens we need.
